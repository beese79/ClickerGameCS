# ClickerGameCS
A small little clicker game/form made with C#

# Prerequisites
### For public
- .NET Framework 6.0+
### For devs
- Visual Studio 2022 Community or better
- .NET addons for Visual Studio
- **NOTE:** Editing the `Form1.cs` file can be done through VS Code, **however**, it is *highly* recommended to edit through Visual Studio for GUI debugging

# Info
Since I'm quite lazy and don't want to learn Unity, I decided to make this through a Windows Form App, since I already had VS experience.
