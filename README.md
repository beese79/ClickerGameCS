# ClickerGameCS
A small little clicker game/form made with C#

# Prerequisites
### For public
- .NET Framework 6.0+
### For devs
- Visual Studio 2022 Community or better
- .NET addons for Visual Studio
- **NOTE:** Editing the `Form1.cs` file can be done through VS Code, **however**, it is *highly* recommended to edit through Visual Studio for GUI debugging

# Info
Since I'm quite lazy and don't want to learn Unity, I decided to make this through a Windows Form App, since I already had VS experience.
*More to come to info later*

# Dev Info
- Committing through VS Code is *in my opinion* easier than committing in Visual Studio, so I can't really help if you're trying to make commits through Visual Studio. **Despite this**, you still can commit through Visual Studio, but if it doesn't work, I can't help
